### Processes, Threads, Thread Pool

- node is single thread
- when running program normally execute several steps
- init program, execute top lv code, require modules, register event callbacks, start event loop

## Thread Pool

- offload work from the event loop by node itself
- handle heavy tasks like: file system apis, crytography, compression, dns lookup

## Event loop

- all the application code that is inside callback functions (non top-level-code)
- node js is build around callback functions
- event driven architecture
- dont do
  - dont use sync function in fs, crypto, zlib modules in ur callback functions
  - dont perform complex calculation
  - be aware of JSON in large objects
  - dont use too complex regular expression

## Events And Event Driven Architecture

- event emitter => event listener => attached callback function

```js
const server = http.createServer();
server.on("request", (req, res) => {
  console.log("request received");
  res.end("request received");
});
// because server is instance of eventemitter class
// the event emitter and event listener also called observer pattern because event listener keep observing the subject that will emit
```

## Event Emmit Example

```js
const EventEmitter = require("events");
const http = require("http");

const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

myEmitter.on("newSale", () => {
  console.log("There was a new sale!");
});

myEmitter.on("newSale", () => {
  console.log("Customer name: Jonas");
});

myEmitter.on("newSale", stock => {
  console.log(`There are now ${stock} items left in stock.`);
});

myEmitter.emit("newSale", 9);

///////////////////////////////

const server = http.createServer();

server.on("request", (req, res) => {
  console.log("Request received");
  res.end("Got it");
});

server.on("request", (req, res) => {
  console.log("Got another request ðŸ¤£");
});

server.on("close", (req, res) => {
  console.log("Server Closed");
});

server.listen(8000, "127.0.0.1", () => {
  console.log("server is running");
});
```

## Introduction to Streams

- used to process data piece by piece without completing the whole read or write operation and therefore without keeping all the data in memory
- four types streams in total: readable streams(http req, fs read), writable streams(http res, fs write), duplex streams(web socket), transform streams(gzip creation)
- streams are instances of the eventemitter class

## Module System

- each javascript is treated as seperate module
- node js use common js module system: require(), exports or module.exports
- es module system is used in browsers: import/export
